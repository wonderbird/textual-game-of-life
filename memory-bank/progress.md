# Progress: Textual Game of Life

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure

**Textual Application Framework**

- ✅ GameApp successfully initializes with header, log widget, and footer
- ✅ Keyboard bindings functional (d=dark mode, n=next generation, r=reset)
- ✅ Dark/light theme switching operational
- ✅ Debug console integration working for development

**MVP Architecture**

- ✅ Abstract UniverseView interface properly defined
- ✅ TextualUniverseView implements Textual-specific rendering
- ✅ UniversePresenter coordinates between model and view
- ✅ Cell value object encapsulates coordinate data

**Basic Universe Visualization**

- ✅ Coordinate grid displays in log widget (0-8 x,y coordinates)
- ✅ Living cells render as █ characters in correct positions
- ✅ View updates properly when cells are added/removed
- ✅ Clear operation resets display to empty grid

### Development Environment

**Setup and Tooling**

- ✅ Virtual environment with Python 3.13+ requirement
- ✅ Requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks configured for code quality
- ✅ Testing framework (pytest) with Textual snapshot testing
- ✅ Debugging tools integrated (textual console)
- ✅ Package installation in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
- ✅ Application execution methods documented and working

## What's Left to Build

### Game of Life Logic Implementation

**Critical Missing Functionality**

- ❌ **Proper neighbor counting**: Currently missing algorithm to count living neighbors
- ❌ **Conway's rules application**: Birth/death/survival rules not implemented
- ❌ **Universe model**: No dedicated class to manage game state and rules
- ❌ **Generation transitions**: Currently hardcoded cell removal, not rule-based

**Algorithm Requirements**

- Implement 8-neighbor counting for each cell position
- Apply Conway's rules:
  - Live cell with 2-3 neighbors survives
  - Dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
  - All other cells die or remain dead
- Generate complete next generation before applying changes

### Configuration System

**Seed Pattern Loading**

- ❌ **TOML file reader**: Parse universe configuration from files
- ❌ **Multiple seed patterns**: Support for different starting configurations
- ❌ **Configurable universe size**: Currently hardcoded 8x8 grid
- ❌ **Pattern library**: Collection of classic Game of Life patterns

### Performance and User Experience

**Optimization Needs**

- ❌ **Efficient cell removal**: Currently clears all cells instead of selective removal
- ❌ **Larger universe support**: Scale beyond current 8x8 limitation
- ❌ **Smooth animations**: Potential for timed generation advancement
- ❌ **Pattern recognition**: Detect oscillators, still lifes, gliders

**Enhanced UI Features**

- ❌ **Cell editing**: Interactive placement/removal of cells
- ❌ **Pattern selection menu**: Choose from predefined patterns
- ❌ **Generation counter**: Display current generation number
- ❌ **Speed controls**: Variable timing for automatic progression

## Current Status

### Working Foundation

**Architecture Solid**

- MVP pattern provides clear development path
- Interface design enables future extensibility
- Textual integration functioning correctly

**Ready for Logic Implementation**

- UI framework prepared for dynamic content
- Model-view coordination established
- Development tools and testing environment operational

### Immediate Development Path

**Phase 1: Core Game Logic**

1. Create Universe model class with proper game state management
2. Implement neighbor counting algorithm
3. Apply Conway's rules for generation transitions
4. Replace hardcoded transitions with rule-based logic

**Phase 2: Configuration**

1. Add TOML file parsing for seed patterns
2. Support multiple universe sizes
3. Create pattern library with classic configurations

**Phase 3: Enhanced Experience**

1. Optimize performance for larger patterns
2. Add user interaction for cell editing
3. Implement automatic progression with timing controls

## Known Issues

### Implementation Gaps

**UniversePresenter.go_to_next_generation()**

- Currently removes single cell at (3,1) regardless of rules
- Needs complete replacement with proper Game of Life logic
- Comments indicate awareness of missing functionality

**TextualUniverseView.remove()**

- Clears entire cell list instead of removing specific cell
- Inefficient and incorrect for selective cell removal
- Needs implementation of targeted cell removal

### Architecture Considerations

**Model Layer Missing**

- UniversePresenter directly manages cell list
- No dedicated Universe class for game logic
- Should separate presentation coordination from game rules

**Testing Coverage**

- Basic test structure exists but limited coverage
- UI testing with Textual snapshots configured but underutilized
- Need comprehensive testing of Game of Life rules implementation

### Resolved Issues

**✅ Application Execution**

- **Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError` when running application directly
- **Solution**: Execute as module (`python -m game_app.game_app`)
- **Development Mode**: `textual run --dev game_app.game_app:GameApp`
- **Root Cause**: Package structure with absolute imports requires proper module context

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Focus: UI Framework

- Started with Textual framework integration
- Established visual representation and user interaction
- Created foundation for game display

### Current Focus: Game Logic

- Recognized need for proper Conway's rules implementation
- Planning separation of game logic from presentation
- Preparing for TOML configuration system

### Future Focus: User Experience

- Enhanced interaction and configuration options
- Performance optimization for larger universes
- Educational features and pattern exploration
