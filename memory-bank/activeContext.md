# Active Context: Textual Game of Life

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority

**Application Execution Resolved**

- âœ… Memory bank successfully established with complete documentation
- âœ… Application execution issues resolved through proper module execution
- âœ… Development workflow clarified with both standard and debug modes
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next**: Ready to implement proper Conway's Game of Life rules

### Project Status Assessment

**Architecture Foundation**

- MVP pattern successfully implemented
- Clear separation between Textual UI and business logic
- Interface-based design allows for future extensibility

**Current Implementation Level**

- Basic UI framework operational with Textual integration
- Hardcoded seed patterns and simplified generation logic
- Manual stepping through generations with keyboard controls

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation & Application Setup

**Documentation Structure Established**

- `projectbrief.md`: Core requirements and success criteria defined
- `productContext.md`: Educational value and user experience goals documented  
- `systemPatterns.md`: MVP architecture and component relationships mapped
- `techContext.md`: Technology stack and development workflow captured

**Execution Issues Resolved**

- **Problem**: Application failed with `ModuleNotFoundError` when run as direct script
- **Root Cause**: Package with absolute imports requires module execution context
- **Solution**: Run as module (`python -m game_app.game_app`) instead of direct script
- **Development Mode**: `textual run --dev game_app.game_app:GameApp` for enhanced debugging

### Code Analysis Findings

**Architectural Strengths**

- Clean MVP separation with abstract UniverseView interface
- Proper event handling through Textual framework
- Simple Cell value object for coordinate management

**Implementation Gaps Identified**

- Game of Life rules not properly implemented (hardcoded transitions)
- Universe model missing neighbor counting logic
- Remove operation inefficient (clears all cells vs selective removal)

## Next Steps

### Critical Development Areas

**Game of Life Logic Implementation**

- Implement proper neighbor counting algorithm
- Apply Conway's rules for cell birth/death/survival
- Create universe model separate from presenter

**Configuration System**

- TOML file loading for seed patterns (as planned in comments)
- Configurable universe size and initial conditions
- User-selectable starting patterns

**Performance Optimization**

- Selective cell removal instead of clearing all
- Efficient neighbor calculation for larger universes
- Optimized rendering for complex patterns

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made

**MVP Over MVC**

- Presenter handles business logic coordination
- View remains focused on Textual-specific rendering
- Clear testing boundaries established

**Interface-First Design**

- Abstract UniverseView enables multiple implementations
- Future support for different UI frameworks possible
- Testing with mock implementations feasible

### Technical Preferences

**Modern Python Features**

- Type hints throughout codebase
- Abstract base classes for interfaces  
- Composition over inheritance patterns

**Development Quality**

- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Textual debugging tools integration
- Comprehensive testing approach planned

## Important Patterns and Insights

### Textual Framework Usage

**Widget Composition**

- Header/Log/Footer standard layout
- Log widget used for universe visualization
- CSS styling through .tcss files

**Event Handling**

- Keyboard bindings defined at app level
- Action methods delegate to view layer
- Clean separation of input handling and business logic

### Code Organization Patterns

**Package Structure**

- Single `game_app` package with clear module responsibilities
- Abstract interfaces in separate modules
- Implementation classes follow interface naming

**Dependency Flow**

- App creates view, view creates presenter
- Presenter manages model, coordinates with view
- Clear unidirectional dependency relationships

## Learning and Project Evolution

### Key Insights

**Terminal UI Capabilities**

- Rich, interactive experiences possible in terminal environment
- Unicode characters (â–ˆ) effective for visual game representation
- Dark/light theme switching enhances user experience

**Architecture Benefits**

- MVP pattern provides clear testing boundaries
- Interface segregation enables future extensions
- Separation of concerns makes codebase maintainable

### Evolution Path

**From Current State**: Basic UI with hardcoded logic
**To Target State**: Full Game of Life with configurable patterns
**Key Milestones**: Proper rules implementation, TOML configuration, performance optimization
