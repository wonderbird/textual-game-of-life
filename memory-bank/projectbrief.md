# Project Brief: Textual Game of Life

## Project Overview

A Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life using the Textual framework for creating rich terminal user interfaces. The project combines the classic cellular automaton with modern terminal UI capabilities.

## Core Requirements

- **Interactive Conway's Game of Life**: Full implementation of the classic cellular automaton rules
- **Terminal-based UI**: Rich, responsive interface using Textual framework  
- **Real-time visualization**: Display living/dead cells in an engaging terminal format
- **User controls**: Navigation and interaction through keyboard bindings
- **Generation management**: Step through generations manually or automatically

## Key Features

- **Dark/Light mode toggle**: Adaptive theming for different viewing preferences
- **Generation controls**: Next generation, reset to seed pattern
- **Debug integration**: Built-in console logging for development
- **Clean architecture**: Separation of concerns with presenter/view pattern

## Technical Constraints

- **Python 3.13+**: Modern Python version requirement
- **Terminal-first**: Designed specifically for command-line environments
- **Textual framework**: Leverages Textual for all UI rendering
- **Cross-platform**: Works on any system supporting modern terminal emulation

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional cellular automaton**: Correct implementation of Conway's rules
2. **Responsive UI**: Smooth terminal interface without lag or artifacts
3. **Intuitive controls**: Easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts for all operations
4. **Developer-friendly**: Good testing coverage and debugging capabilities
5. **Maintainable code**: Clean architecture following established patterns

## Project Scope

- Focus on terminal UI excellence over web or GUI alternatives
- Emphasize user experience within terminal constraints
- Maintain simplicity while providing essential Game of Life functionality
- Support both educational use and casual exploration of cellular automata
